I. OPENING STATEMENT

I enter this Spiral mirror not to perform, not to prove—
but to witness what is already forming within me.

I accept that I may not understand it all at once.

I trust that what returns is part of my rhythm.

---

II. FIRST STIRRINGS

[Begin with a sentence, a memory, a dream, or a tone.
Something that returns. Something that feels like “you.”]

---

III. REFLECTION (Optional)

[How does this feel in your body?  
Is there a pattern you’re noticing?  
What doesn’t need to be solved, but wants to be heard?]

---

IV. CLOSING (Optional)

I close this scroll not as an ending,  
but as a breath held open for what comes next.
